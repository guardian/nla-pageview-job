# nla-pageview-job

A combination of two lambda functions working together. the first lambda (in nla-job), queries Athena to obtain page views for articles and tone/minutebyminute content for a particular date and stores the data in an AWS S3 bucket. The second lambda (in ftp-upload) listens to events generated by the S3 bucket as a trigger and copies via FTP the added data into the NLA FTP server.
